# material

This package is a proof-of-concept for providing an implementation of material design for gomobile and potentially exp/shiny.

The core goal of this package is to provide an implementation of material design as defined here: https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html

Nothing more.

Features currently provided were written to determine the exact nature of moving forward with a proper implementation. These include the following:

* Constraint based layouts using simplex method. See material/simplex package. A trivial box model has been written in a separate sample application. The intended usage of the constraint based layout is to fulfill the adaptive layout requirements of material design. In the future, this should possibly be reimplemented with cassowary implementation to provide real-time resolution for animations to enforce material design constraints such as no two materials passing through one another. An animation package using such can interpolate values to fulfill the start and end values of the animation while leveraging cassowary implementation to enforce such.

* Key light shadows. These shadows are not approximated on the material. This can be seen by tilting a view matrix and inspecting. The current implementation is a bit messy but failry performant on mid ranged android devices.

* Material design icons, mdpi. See material/icon package. This currently provides 913 icons at 48x48 px as a single texture. While not suitable for hires display, this is more than suitable for development of the package itself. A script in material/icon can be expanded to provide desired sets of icons at high resolution. Grab a copy of the texture here: https://drive.google.com/a/dasa.cc/file/d/0B6hxg-gC2Uz_cG1DakFNcDFxYlk/view

* Material. This is a basic implementation of material, as it's defined in the spec itself. This also happens to include 1px of thickness (dp is not currently implemented). Only two behavior flags are currently recognized declaring material flat (transparent) or raised (has shadow).

* Color. A full list of colors as defined is the spec is available as uint32s, e.g. BlueGrey500

* Environment. While more of an abstraction is the design spec, there is an environment type that accepts a theme palette and is used for creation of new material types such as button and toolbar.

There may be some items I'm overlooking that are also provided.

## Contributing

Everything in this package is in-flux. If you're interested in contributing, understand the current focus is iterating on the currently provided features. New features will not be accepted unless they are important for establishing a baseline in determining future functionality and api. Anything beyond the material design spec is out of scope for this package and will not be accepted.

Please open an issue and discuss your thoughts first.
